# ![Logo](https://raw.github.com/furudbat/fap/master/icon/icon-64.png) FAP - FurAffinity Patcher (Browser Extension)

The FurAffinity Patcher is a Browser Extension with some Content Scripts for [https://www.furaffinity.net/](https://www.furaffinity.net/).  
Adding some Client-Side features like Edit-Preview and some smaller tweaks.  

It all began with _"Why can't I see icons on my Watchlist ?â€œ_, _"Who is this again ?"_ or _"No preview rendering in Submission-Upload-Page D:"_. :)  
I know [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/) is an older site, but it's really sad to see no major feature updates in the last time. :'(  

This project should be small and adds some life improvements. I hope [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/) gives us native Blacklist on the serverside, soon and some other fixes.   

FAP is mainly developed on Chrome and Firefox, but should be cross-browser, see [Development](#development).



### Changes

 - smaller Tweaks on Profile- and Submission-Page
 - Editor with BBCode-Preview
 - Notes-List with search and sort
 - hide Submissions: General, Mature or/and Adult
