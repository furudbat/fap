The [B][U]FurAffinity Patcher[/U][/B] is a Browser Extension with some Content Scripts for [URL='https://www.furaffinity.net/']Index -- Fur Affinity [dot] net[/URL].
Adding some Client-Side features like Blacklist, Edit-Preview and some smaller tweaks.

It all began with [I]"No preview rendering in Submission-Upload-Page D:"[/I]. :)
I know [URL='https://www.furaffinity.net/']FA[/URL] is an older site, but it's really sad to see no major feature updates in the last time. :'(

This project should be small and adds some life improvements. I hope [URL=https://www.furaffinity.net/]FA[/URL] gives us native Blacklist on the Serverside, soon and some other fixes.
[URL=https://furrynetwork.com/]FN[/URL] seems to be a good competitor, I hope for the best, because competition is good.

FAP is mainly developed on Chrome and Firefox, but should be cross-browser, see Development.
Keep in mind guys this is my first Browse-Extension I made and it's still in development ^^
